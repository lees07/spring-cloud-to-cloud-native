# From Spring Cloud to Cloud Native

Migrate spring cloud demo app from [spring-cloud-pet-project](https://github.com/27rahulk/cloud-pet-project.git) to pure spring boot app to deploy on OpenShift Container Platform and use Service Mesh 2.x functions.  

The [guide of migration](./guide-for-migration/GUIDE4MIGRATION.md) is only Chinese version.
